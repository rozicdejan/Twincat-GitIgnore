# TwinCAT XAE Version Control Setup with Git

This document outlines the steps to configure TwinCAT XAE for version control using Git.

## Prerequisites

- **Git**: Make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/).
- **TwinCAT XAE**: Installed and configured for your project.

## Step 1: Initialize Git in Your Project

1. Open a terminal or Git Bash in your TwinCAT project folder.
2. Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
  ```
3.Alternatively, you can use Git GUI tools like TortoiseGit or GitHub Desktop to initialize the repository.

## Step 2: Create a .gitignore File
  ```bash
    # TwinCAT build files
    **/Temp/*
    **/Boot/*
    *.tpy
    *.compiled-library
    *.objects
    *.plcproj.user

    # Ignore specific TwinCAT configuration files
    *.tmc
    *.tmproj
    *.tmproj.user
    *.sdf

    # Visual Studio build and project files
    *.obj
    *.exe
    *.log
    *.user
    *.suo
    *.pdb
    *.ilk
    *.idb
    *.ipch
    *.aps
    *.ncb
    *.opendb
    *.opensdf
    *.iobj
    *.ipdb

    # TwinCAT Generated Project files
    _tc*

    # TwinCAT symbol files
    *_Symbols.c
    *_Server.c

    # Auto-generated or machine-specific settings
    .tcposm

    # Ignore TwinCAT source control cache
    TcSourceControl.lock
    TcSourceControl.State.xml

    # Backup files
    *.bak
    *.backup
    *.tmp
```
### Step 3: Set Up Git in TwinCAT XAE
Open TwinCAT XAE and go to Tools -> Options -> Source Control.
Select Git from the list of source control providers.
This will allow you to manage your Git operations directly from within TwinCAT XAE.
Step 4: Manage Files for Version Control
When working with TwinCAT XAE and Git, ensure the following:

Include:

*.tsproj (Solution/project files)
*.plcproj (PLC project files)
Source code files (*.TcPOU, *.TcGVL, *.TcDUT, etc.)
Exclude:

Auto-generated files like *.tpy, *_Symbols.c, and build artifacts (handled by .gitignore).
Step 5: Commit and Push Changes
Add the necessary files to the staging area:

```bash
git add .
Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
```
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit for TwinCAT project"
```
Push your changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):

```bash
git remote add origin <remote-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```
### Step 6: Working with Branches
Use Git branches to manage different versions of your TwinCAT project. For example, to create a new feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```
### Step 7: Collaborative Work
If working in a team:

Pull the latest changes from the remote repository before starting new work.
Push your changes after committing, and ensure there are no merge conflicts.
Additional Tips
Backup Project Settings: Local machine-specific settings like *.plcproj.user should generally be excluded from version control.
Regular Commits: Commit regularly with meaningful messages to track changes over time.
Conclusion
Following these steps will ensure that your TwinCAT XAE project is properly configured for Git version control, helping you track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean repository.
